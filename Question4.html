    <h1>I am bread</h1>
    <img src="breadtoaster.jpg" alt="bread" width="400px">
    <p>This is my bread. There are many like it, but this one is mine. Bread is my favourite breakfast. Plain toast is the best. 
        Sometimes I like to put it in the toaster. Sometimes i like to spread jam. I must consume my bread everyday.
        Without me, my bread is useless. Without my bread, I am useless. LOL
